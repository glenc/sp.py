import sp
from sp import *

# enumerate all sites and print out the url
sp.enum_sites("http://myserver", lambda s: print s.Url)

# apply a master page to all webs
def apply_theme(web):
	web.MasterUrl = "http://myserver/custom.master"
	web.Update()

sp.enum_all_webs("http://myserver", apply_theme)
```
	
	
# Calling scripts in the scripts module
