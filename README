This library provides the ability to automate various
SharePoint activities through easy to read and modify Python
scripts.

The core library is located in the sp module.  The scripts
module contains a number of scripts for performing specific
activities such as backing up sites.

	# apply a master page to all webs
	def apply_theme(web):
		web.MasterUrl = "http://myserver/custom.master"
		web.Update()
